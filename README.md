# Trajectory-Optimization
Simple examples of trajectory optimization with GEKKO.  
GEKKO is really cool library that easy to handle for every engineer, allows implementing collocation method in minimum code.  

In this repository, some rocket design examples are introduced.  
-Minimize flight time with end point constraint  
-Maximaize down-range    

Future Work  
User interface
